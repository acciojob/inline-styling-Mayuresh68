			A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants 
			(plants of the division Angiospermae). Flowers produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants consist of 
			a few haploid cells which produce gametes. The "male" gametophyte, which produces non-motile sperm, is 
			enclosed within pollen grains; the "female" gametophyte is contained within the ovule.
